Alpha channel
==
For years steganography has been used in many circumstances by a lot of people
around the world, each of them with different goals, but with only one reason,
to hide the information. Today steganography could be say to be not quite a
popular subject but yet it's a very advance field with scary algorithms and
very advance methods; information can be hidden almost everywhere.

This program can be used to introduce information inside an image's alpha
channel. Although, it has several limitations, for instance, one cannot use
binary data or another image format apart from PNG with this program.

This program depends on, the chunky_png gem.
	gem install chunky_png
